/**
 * The {@code SimplePoint} class is a subclass of {@link java.awt.Point} used to represent
 * 2D coordinate points in a crossword puzzle grid.
 * 
 * This class currently overrides the {@code equals} method but does not provide a valid
 * equality check, always returning {@code false}. This may affect functionality when
 * used in collections or comparisons unless updated properly.
 *
 * Overriding {@code equals} without a proper implementation may lead to
 * incorrect behavior in hash-based structures like {@code HashMap} or {@code HashSet}.
